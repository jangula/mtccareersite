## The Current Challenge

### MTC's Existing Recruitment Process

| Current State | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| **Third-party job boards** | Inconsistent availability and reliability |
| **Hand-delivered applications** | Excludes candidates outside Windhoek; creates manual processing burden |
| **No centralized tracking** | Difficult to manage pipeline and provide status updates |
| **Fragmented candidate data** | Information scattered across emails, physical documents, and spreadsheets |
| **Limited employer branding** | Generic job board listings don't showcase MTC culture |
| **Manual communication** | HR staff must individually email each candidate |

### The Risk of Inaction

- **Talent Loss**: Top candidates expect modern, mobile-friendly application processes
- **Brand Perception**: Manual processes contradict MTC's position as a digital leader
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Other employers offer seamless online experiences
- **Inefficiency Costs**: HR time spent on administrative tasks instead of strategic hiring
- **Compliance Gaps**: No audit trail for recruitment decisions

## Digital Transformation Value

### From Manual to Digital: A Complete Transformation

| Before (Current State) | After (MTC Career Portal) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Job ads on third-party sites with inconsistent uptime | Always-available, MTC-branded career site |
| "Hand deliver applications to HR" | Apply online from anywhere, any device |

**The MTC Career Portal demonstrates digital leadership by example:**

- **Mobile-First Design**: Candidates can apply from their MTC-connected smartphones
- **Paperless Process**: Fully digital from application to offer
- **Instant Communication**: Automated emails keep candidates informed
- **24/7 Availability**: Apply anytime, not just during office hours
